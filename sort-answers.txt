sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?:
Bubble Sort and Selection Sort both have O(n^2), so
Sort 1 and Sort 3 look similar until you get to the already
sorted files - sorted50000.txt runs at .548 on Sort 1 and
3.318 on Sort 3. The Bubble Sort has 立(n) compared to 立(n^2) for
Selection Sort, so Bubble Sort would be faster on an already
sorted array.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:
Sort 2 is significantly faster than both
Sort 1 and Sort 3, which makes sense because
its upper and lower bounds are n log n, compared
to n^2 or n.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It's the last choice left, but the
reasoning is the same as it is for Bubble Sort. Looking
at the already sorted arrays, Sort 3 is slower reflecting its
立(n^2) compared to Bubble Sort's 立(n).
